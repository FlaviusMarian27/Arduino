# Arduino Projects

This repository contains all of my Arduino-based projects. The goal is to keep everything in one place â€” from code and schematics to ideas and documentation.

## What you'll find here:

- Source code for various Arduino projects
- Wiring diagrams (Fritzing or hand-drawn)
- Photos and/or demo videos (when available)
- Assembly instructions and usage notes

## Upcoming / Work-in-progress Projects:

- Motion sensor light automation system  
- Digital thermometer with LCD display  
- Automatic plant watering system  
- Proximity sensor alarm  

---

Each project will be organized in its own folder, with a dedicated README for more specific details.
